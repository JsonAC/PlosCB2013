This is the repository where I am storing the code used to generate the data used in the Plos Computational Biology article named "Passive Dendrites Enable Single Neuron to Compute Linearly Non-separable Functions"
Every code snippet I put here is under the CCAL licence. Please to cite the Plos Computational Biology article if you reuse the code in a publication.
